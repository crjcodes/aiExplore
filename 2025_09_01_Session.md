## **Portfolio Project Example: AI-Powered Audiobook Pipeline**

### **Overview**  
This project demonstrates how AI can transform a raw short story into a polished audiobook using **Python**, the **OpenAI API**, and a development workflow in **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.  

The pipeline integrates text processing, AI voice synthesis, and automated file export, showcasing how modern AI tools can be applied to real-world creative and engineering workflows.  

### **Pipeline Design**
1. **Input Stage:** Load raw short story text.  
2. **Refinement Stage:** Use OpenAI’s GPT API to clean grammar, structure paragraphs, and prepare narration script.  
3. **Synthesis Stage:** Pass narration script to TTS API for voice generation.  
4. **Post-Processing Stage:** Merge audio files, normalize volume, and export to MP3.  
5. **Output Stage:** Generate audiobook-ready file with metadata.  

### **Sample Code (Python)**
```python
import openai
import requests

# --- 1. Load text ---
with open("story.txt", "r") as f:
    raw_text = f.read()

# --- 2. Refine text with GPT ---
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Refine this story for audiobook narration."},
        {"role": "user", "content": raw_text}
    ]
)
narration_text = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]

# --- 3. Convert to speech with TTS API (e.g., ElevenLabs) ---
tts_api_url = "https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/voice"
headers = {"xi-api-key": "YOUR_TTS_KEY"}
payload = {"text": narration_text, "voice_settings": {"stability": 0.5}}

audio_response = requests.post(tts_api_url, headers=headers, json=payload)
with open("audiobook.mp3", "wb") as out:
    out.write(audio_response.content)
