# **Portfolio Project: AI-Powered Audiobook Pipeline**

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates how AI can transform a raw short story into a polished audiobook using **Python**, the **OpenAI API**, and **VS Code**. The pipeline integrates text processing, AI voice synthesis, and automated audio export, showing how AI can be applied to real-world software engineering workflows.

---

## **Objectives**
- Automate text-to-audio conversion.  
- Apply GPT for text refinement and TTS for voice generation.  
- Build a reusable, modular pipeline for future extensions (translations, distribution, metadata automation).  

---

## **Technology Stack**
- Python 3.11+  
- OpenAI GPT-5 API  
- Text-to-Speech API (ElevenLabs or Azure Cognitive Services)  
- VS Code  
- FFmpeg  

---

## **Pipeline Design**
1. **Input Stage:** Load raw short story text.  
2. **Refinement Stage:** Use GPT API to clean and prepare narration scripts.  
3. **Synthesis Stage:** Convert narration text to speech with TTS API.  
4. **Post-Processing Stage:** Merge audio segments, normalize volume, export to MP3.  
5. **Output Stage:** Generate audiobook-ready file with metadata.  

---

## **Sample Python Code**
\`\`\`python
import openai
import requests

# --- 1. Load text ---
with open("story.txt", "r") as f:
    raw_text = f.read()

# --- 2. Refine text with GPT ---
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Refine this story for audiobook narration."},
        {"role": "user", "content": raw_text}
    ]
)
narration_text = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]

# --- 3. Convert to speech with TTS API ---
tts_api_url = "https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/voice"
headers = {"xi-api-key": "YOUR_TTS_KEY"}
payload = {"text": narration_text, "voice_settings": {"stability": 0.5}}

audio_response = requests.post(tts_api_url, headers=headers, json=payload)
with open("audiobook.mp3", "wb") as out:
    out.write(audio_response.content)
\`\`\`

---

## **Outcomes**
- Produced a complete audiobook from raw text.  
- Demonstrated chaining of multiple AI services in a reproducible workflow.  
- Created a foundation for extensions: translations, metadata automation, global distribution.  

---

## **Employer Takeaway**
- **Applied AI Engineering:** Practical use of GPT for text processing and TTS for audio output.  
- **Automation Skills:** Built scalable pipelines integrating multiple APIs.  
- **Portfolio Value:** Polished, demonstrable artifact showcasing applied AI knowledge.
